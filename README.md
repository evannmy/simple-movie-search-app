This project is a **simple movie search web application** that utilizes the public OMDB API. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with **Bootstrap** and **jQuery** included via CDN for a clean UI and efficient DOM manipulation. Users can **search for movie information** by title, and the app will display the movie poster, title, release year, and a brief summary. ðŸŽ¬
